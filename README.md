**Projet 0** : Dynamic memory allocation | ðŸ“… *November 7 2024*

The aim of this project was to implement, in groups of 2, our **own memory management algorithm**. You'll find our rewriting of **malloc** and **free** in ***C***. These functions manage a simple byte array that simulates the *Heap*. For more information, the **instructions** asked and our **report** can be found in pdf format in this folder.
